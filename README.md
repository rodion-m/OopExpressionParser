# What is it?
This is perhaps the most simple lexer and parser written on clean C#, so I guess it helps someone to understand a conception of parsers developing.

It's able to evaluate simple expressions like `"2+2*2"`. It supports `+,-,*,/`. But you can easyly add your own operation just by addig a new class inherited from `Operation` class and it became work, so it's super easy.
Brackets are not supported at the moment.
